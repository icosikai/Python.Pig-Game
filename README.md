# Python.Pig-Game 🐷🎲
2-4 Player Pig Game, created using Python. The first player to 50 points wins.

## What is pig? ❓
- Pig is a 2-4 player game, where each player takes turns rolling a die. The result (number) of the die is added to the player's score each time.
- Normally, both players can roll however many times they want, and can choose to stop rolling at any time. However, if the number is a one, the player must stop rolling and give their turn to the other player. Additionally, rolling a one will reset the player's score to 0.
- The overall goal of Pig is to be the first player to reach a score of 50 or greater.

## Additional Notes ⭐
- This was one of my first major coding projects. It was originally completed during the summer of 2025, but I have since gone back to it to make a few edits.

Overall, thank you for taking the time to look at my project. I would appreciate if you shared any suggestions or additional ideas of finding a better solution!
